Notes:

1. This algorithm might fail in specific cases, where the difference between
   a and b or any combination of a, b and the innerCounter would result in
   reaching c but simply multiplying the counter would not. Trying to find
   relevant number pairs. Committed to a new branch for testing (test1).
2. Fixed bug where I forgot to switch the parameters I'm passing in to
   the method findCounterBeforeTimeToReach.
